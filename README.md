This is fysh.

```
><>
```

Fysh have to be terminated `~`.

```
><> ~
```

This is Steven.

```
><steven> ~
```

Steven has binary scales. `}` represents 1 and `)` represents 0. Steven is
valued at `b101`. (5 in decimal)

```
><steven> = ><})}> ~
```

Steven doesnâ€™t give a flying fysh about their scale direction. â‰ˆ for variable
assignment is cool with them too.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><}({> ~
```

Steven is blind. You have the power to bless them with sight, but it's
completely optional.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{({Â°> ~
><steven> = ><{({o> ~
```

When there is a school of fysh, their collective value is equal to the sum of
each individual member. This gives Steven a value of `b101 = b100+ b001`.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{((Â°> ><(({Â°> ~
```

Sometimes fysh want to be different and swim the other direction. This takes
away from the schoolâ€™s value. This gives Steven a value of.
`b101 = b111 - b010`.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{{Â°> <Â°)})>< ~
```

Fysh often get lonely. This loneliness causes fysh to meet new fysh and
proliferate. This gives Steven a value of `b101010 = b110 * b111`.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{(Â°> â™¡ ><{{{Â°> ~
```

Since the fysh are lonely, they aren't too picky. Theyâ€™ll make do with a lesser
form of love `<3`.

```
><steven> = ><{{(o> <3 ><{{{o> ~
```

Not every fysh story is a happy one. At times, separation is unavoidable, and
their division is symbolized by a heartbreak.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{(({Â°> ðŸ’” ><{({Â°> ~
><steven> = ><{{(({o> </3 ><{({o> ~
```

Fysh are often mistreated are forced into fyshbowls for human entertainment. This isolates the fysh and makes them sad. This is represented by `( ><{{(({Â°> <Â°}))}>< )`. 
```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><steven> ðŸ’” ( ><{{(({Â°> <Â°}))>< ) ~
```

BEDMAS/PEDMAS has been taught to humans for years. But what about fysh? Fysh have a different way of doing things. Introducing FISHS: Fyshbowl, Increment, Sexual reproduction, Heartbreak, School of fish.
```fysh
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{(({Â°>  ><{{(Â°> â™¡ ><{{(({Â°> <Â°}})>< ðŸ’” ( ><{{(Â°> ><{{(Â°> )  ~

```

As life goes on, we learn from our mistakes and improve. Stevenâ€™s self help
journey allowed them to grow an extra tail, incrementing their value by 1.
```
>><steven> ~
```

Sometimes we feel like a fyshup, a failure. And that's ok, itâ€™s a part of being
fysh. However for some fysh, this feeling is too much to handle and is
internalized. They havenâ€™t received the emotional support they need and have
gone on a downward spiral, causing them to feel worthless. They begin to retreat
and try to swim away in the opposite direction causing their value to decrement
by 1.

```
<steven><< ~
```

Sometimes Steven fyshs up and throws an error. This can be done using two WTF
(What The Fysh) encompassing a string.

```
><!@#$>
	What The Fysh?!
<!@#$><
```

Not all fysh are created equal. But sometimes they are. We can check this using
`â‰ˆâ‰ˆ` or `==`.

```
><steven> â‰ˆâ‰ˆ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> == ><theFysh> ~
```

But sometimes we want to ensure that two fysh are different. This can be done
using `~â‰ˆ` or `~=`.

```
><steven> ~â‰ˆ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> ~= ><theFysh> ~
```

Tadpoles also exist in the fysh language. Tadpoles swim towards bigger fysh
(they like the danger) and are represented by `~o or o~`. ( `~o is <`, `o~ is >`).
Here we are checking if Steven is bigger than 5. Then if they're less than 7.

```fysh
><steven> o~ ><{({Â°>
><steven> ~o ><{{{Â°>
```

Tadpoles aren`t too picky and will also swim towards fysh that are greater than or equal to the other fysh. 
Here we are checking if Steven is greater than or equal to 5. Then if they're less than or equal to 7.

```fysh
><steven> o~â‰ˆ ><{({Â°>
><steven> ~oâ‰ˆ ><{{{Â°>
```

Steven is a curious fysh and often wonders if the world is as it seems. They
ponder the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. They seek the truth,
and if both steven and theTruth are true, they find it. (Steven && theTruth). Or
if steven or theTruth is true, they find it. (Steven || theTruth). or if steven
is not real and this is all a simulation, they find it. (!!Steven)

```
><steven> && ><theTruth> ~
><steven> || ><theTruth> ~
!! ><steven> ~
```

Steven is looking for a change and is interested in having their bits
rearranged. Given it's 2024, a time when open-mindedness prevails, Steven has a
variety of bitwise manipulation techniques at their disposal: `AND (&)`, `OR (|)`,
`XOR (^)`, `NOT (!)`. For those moments when they're feeling particularly
adventurous, they might even consider the `logical shift left (<<)` or
`logical shift right (>>)` operators.

```
><steven> &  ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> |  ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> ^  ><{((Â°> ~
! ><steven> ~
><steven> << ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> >> ><{((Â°> ~
```

In the whirlpool of fysh logic, the while loop, symbolized by `><(((@>`,
ensnares conditions within `[ ]` , with `><>` and `<><` encapsulating the
iterative heart.

```
><(((@> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><
```

Navigating through decision streams, if and else statements flow naturally.
`><(((^>` marks the if, >`<(((*> ><(((^>` for else if, and `><(((*>` for the
uncharted else.

```
><(((^> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><

><(((*> ><(((^> [ ><steven> ~o ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	>><steven> ~
<><

><(((*>
><>
	><steven> â‰ˆ ><(((Â°> ~
<><
```

This is a grilled fysh. It generates a random 32-bit number that determines the
doneness of the fysh.

```
><###> ~
```

Navigator fysh are used to guide the reader through the code. They are
represented by `><//>`.

```
><//> Dayum, fysh got grillz
```

Sometimes, the journey through the code is long and arduous. In these cases,
multiline comments are used to provide a more detailed explanation of the code.
They are represented by `></*>` and `<*\><`.

```
></*>
How to grill a fysh:
1. Get a fysh
2. Grill the fysh
3. Eat the fysh
<*/><
```

A fysh tank `[ ]` is an array of fysh separated by fysh food `-`.

```
><steven> â‰ˆ [><({(Â°> - ><({(Â°>] ~
```

These fysh tanks can be traversed using a fysh.

```
><steven>[><(({Â°>] ~
```

### Factorial Example

```
><//> Comment

><number>    â‰ˆ ><{({Â°> ~  ><//> b101 = 5
><factorial> â‰ˆ ><(({Â°> ~  ><//> b001 = 1

><//> while number > 1
><(((@> [><number> o~ ><(({Â°>]
><>
	><//> factorial = factorial * number
	><factorial> â‰ˆ ><factorial> â™¡ ><number> ~

	><//> number -= 1
	<number><< ~
<><
```
