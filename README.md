If you want to format the code, you will need `emacs`.

Then run:

## Naming Convention

This is actually getting confusing ðŸ˜­ especially without an LSP.

We don't need a good convention, we just need one.

- `NAME_i` - input port
- `NAME_o` - output port
- `NAME_t` - type
- `NAME_inst` - component instance

To also not confuse non-annotated identifiers with the annotated identifiers, we
should not end a variable name with `_[^iot]`.
