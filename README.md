## Naming Convention

This is actually getting confusing ðŸ˜­ especially without an LSP.

We don't need a good convention, we just need one.

- Identifiers
    - `NAME_i` - input port
    - `NAME_o` - output port
    - `NAME_s` - signal
    - `NAME_t` - type

- Labels
    - `NAME_u` - component instance
    - `NAME_p` - process
    - `NAME_g` - generate
