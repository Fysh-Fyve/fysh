# 🌊 Dive into Fysh: A Programming Language for the World to Sea 🐠

## Welcome to the Oceanic Future of Coding!

### 🐬 Meet Fysh: Not Just Another Drop in the Programming Waters 🌟

**Introducing Fysh** - the latest, greatest splash in the programming waters!
Fysh isn't your garden-variety coding language; it's the world's most
_inclusive_ dialect, decipherable by terrestrials and sea creatures alike\*. Imagine a language so fluid, so versatile, that dolphins could debug your code and octopuses parallelize your processes. It's not just a programming language; it's an aquatic revolution!

### 🐟 A Revolutionary Ripple in the Digital Ocean

For centuries, the fishy citizens of our planet's vast waters have been
overlooked, their contributions to the tech world as invisible as their thoughts
on quantum mechanics. But no longer! Fysh gives these silent swimmers the
platform they've always deserved. At last, there's a beacon of hope, a
symbol of unity across species, a... well, let's be honest, a bit of a wet dream for those who've always believed in inter-species collaboration.

### 🌐 Fysh: Coding Without Borders

Fysh – because why should humans have all the fun? With Fysh, we're scripting a
better, brighter, more inclusive tomorrow. Envision a world where salmon suggest
improvements to your UI, and jellyfish judiciously refactor your backend.
Together, we can create a wave of change, one line of code at a time.

### 🚫 **Discalmers:**

- **Aquatic Comprehension**\*: The ability of sea creatures to actually
  understand Fysh remains unconfirmed. Any effort to test this understanding
  might result in puzzled expressions from marine and terrestrial observers.

- **Communication Limitations**: Given the current linguistic barrier with our
  underwater counterparts, Fysh temporarily excludes string variables. Our
  marine linguistics team is diving deep into oceanic communication and promises updates as new discoveries surface.

Dive into Fysh, and let's make waves in the world of programming, together!

## 👩‍💻 How to compyle and run fysh:

TODO: Add instructions on how to compile and run fysh.

## 🐠 Fysh Syntax
This is fysh.

```fysh
><>
```

Fysh have to be terminated `~`.

```fysh
><> ~
```

This is Steven.

```fysh
><steven> ~
```

Steven has binary scales. `}` represents 1 and `)` represents 0. Steven is
valued at `0b101`. (5 in decimal)

```fysh
><steven> = ><})}> ~
```

Steven doesn’t give a flying fysh about scale direction. ≈ for variable
assignment is cool with them too.

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><}({> ~
```

Steven is blind. You have the power to bless them with sight, but it's
completely optional. (you can make them biblically accurate by giving them multiple eyes)

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{({°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{({o> ~

><steven> ≈ ><{({°°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{({o°> ~

><steven> = ><{({°o°> ~
```

A school of fysh's value is equal to the sum of each individual member. 
This gives Steven a value of `0b101 = 0b100 + 0b001`. (5 = 4 + 1)

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{((°> ><(({°> ~
```

Sometimes fysh want to be different and swim the other direction. 
This takes away from the school’s value. This gives Steven a value of.
`0b101 = 0b111 - 0b010`. (5 = 7 - 2)

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{{{°> <°)})>< ~
```

Fysh often get lonely. This loneliness causes fysh to meet new fysh and
proliferate. This gives Steven a value of `0b101010 = 0b110 * 0b111`. (42 = 6 * 7)

```fysh
><steven> = ><{{(°> <3 ><{{{°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{{(°>  ♡ ><{{{°> ~

><steven> ≈ ><{{(°> ❤️ ><{{{°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{{(°> ❤️‍🔥 ><{{{°> ~

><steven> ≈ ><{{(°> 🫀 ><{{{°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{{(°> 🫶 ><{{{°> ~

.
.
.

><//> (Should work with any heart, if we're missing any, let us know)
```

Not every fysh story is a happy one. At times, separation is unavoidable, and
their division breaks their heart. This gives Steven a value of
`0b101 = 0b11001 / 0b101`. (5 = 25 / 5)

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{{(({°> 💔 ><{({°> ~
><steven> = ><{{(({o> </3 ><{({o> ~
```

Fysh are often abducted and forced into fyshbowls for terrestrials'
amusment. This isolates the fysh and makes them sad. Fyshbowls are
represented by `( )`. This gives Steven a value of
`0b101 = 0b101 / (0b101 - 0b100)`. (5 = 5 / (5 - 4))

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{({°> 💔 ( ><{({°> <°}))>< ) ~
```

As life goes on, we learn from our mistakes and improve. Steven’s self help
journey allowed them to grow an extra tail, incrementing their value by 1.

```fysh
>><steven> ~
```

Sometimes we feel like a fyshup, a failure. And that's ok, it’s a part of being
fysh. However for some fysh, this feeling is too much to handle and is
internalized. They haven’t received the emotional support they need and have
gone on a downward spiral, causing them to feel worthless. They begin to retreat
and try to swim away in the opposite direction causing their value to decrement
by 1.

```fysh
<steven><< ~
```

BEDMAS/PEMDAS has been taught to humans for over a century. But what about fysh?
Fysh have a different way of doing things. Introducing FISHS: Fyshbowl,
Increment, Species reproduction, Heartbreak, and School of fish ( (), >><>, ♡ , 💔, ><> <>< ). 
This gives Steven a value of
`0b10101111 = (0b11001 + 1) + 0b110 * 0b11001 - 0b1100 / (0b110 + 0b110)`. (175 = (25 + 1) + 6 * 25 - 12 / (6 + 6))

```fysh
><steven> ≈ >><{{(({°>  ><{{(°> ♡ ><{{(({°> <°}}))>< 💔 ( ><{{(°> ><{{(°> )  ~
```

Sometimes Steven fyshs up and throws an error. This can be done using two WTF
(What The Fysh) fysh encompassing a string.

```fysh
><!@#$>
	What The Fysh?!
<!@#$><
```

Navigator fysh are used to guide the reader through the code. They are
represented by `><//>`. (comments)

```fysh
><//> What's cookin good lookin?
```

Sometimes, the journey through the sea of code is long and dark. In these cases,
multiline comments are used to provide a more detailed explanation of the code.
They are represented by `></*>` and `<*\><`. (multiline comments)

```fysh
></*>
How to grill a fysh:
1. Catch a fysh
2. Grill the fysh
3. Eat the fysh
<*/><
```

This is a grilled fysh. It generates a random signed 32-bit number that determines the
doneness of the fysh.

```fysh
><###> ~
```

Not all fysh are created equal. But sometimes they are. We can check using `≈≈`
or `==`.

```fysh
><steven> ≈≈ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> == ><theFysh> ~
```

Sometimes we want to check if two fysh are different. This can be done using
`~≈` or `~=`.

```fysh
><steven> ~≈ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> ~= ><theFysh> ~
```

Tadpoles are fysh too. They swim towards bigger fysh
(they like the danger) and are represented by `~o or o~`. Here we are checking
if Steven is bigger than 5 and less than 7 respectively. 

```fysh
><//> Greater/Less than
><steven> o~ ><{({°>
><steven> ~o ><{{{°>

><//> Greater/Less than or equal to (replace ~ with ≈ or =)
><steven> o= ><{({°>
><steven> ≈o ><{{{°>
```

Steven is experiencing an existential crisis. They are questioning the very fabric of reality.
- If steven is real `and` they found the truth, they are happy. (Steven && theTruth)
- Steven would also be happy if either they are real `or` if they found the truth. (Steven || theTruth)
- But then Steven thought about it and thought "hey it would be kinda cool if I wasn't real" and are only happy if they are `not` real. (!!Steven)

```fysh
><steven> && ><theTruth> ~
><steven> || ><theTruth> ~
!! ><steven> ~
```

Steven is bored and looking to have their bits rearranged. At Fysh, we're here
to help! We have provided Steven with a variety of tools and bitwise
manipulations to satisfy their bit busting needs: 
- `AND (&)`
- `OR (|)`,
- `XOR (^)`
- `NOT (!)`

```fysh
><steven> &  ><{((°> ~
><steven> |  ><{((°> ~
><steven> ^  ><{((°> ~
! ><steven> ~
```
  
For those moments when they're feeling particularly
adventurous, they might even consider logical shift operations:
- `logical shift left (<<)` 
- `logical shift right (>>)` 

```fysh
><steven> << ><{((°> ~
><steven> >> ><{((°> ~
```

In the whirlpool of fysh logic, the while loop, symbolized by `><(((@>` or `><@>`,
ensnaring conditions within a fysh tank`[ ]`, with `><>` and `<><` encapsulating the
iterative heart.

```fysh
><(((@> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><

><@> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><
```

Conditonal starements run based on how each fysh feels.
- `If statements` are happy since they're the condition you're looking for. It helps validate them and improve their self-esteem. `><(((^>`
- `Else statements` feel like they're the last resort, an afterthought. This makes them feel unimportant and sad. They are represended by a dead fysh `><(((*>`
- `Else if statements` are the middle child, they're not the first choice but they're not the last either. They're the middle ground. They are represented by both a happy and a dead fysh `><(((*> ><(((^>`

Conditions are encapsulated within a fysh tank `[ ]`, with `><>` and `<><` encapsulating the conditional heart.

```fysh
><//> if statement
><(((^> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><

><//> else if statement
><(((*> ><(((^> [ ><steven> ~o ><{((°> ]
><>
	>><steven> ~
<><

><//> else statement
><(((*>
><>
	><steven> ≈ ><(((°> ~
<><
```

A fysh tank `[ ]` is also used for an array of fysh that is seperated by fysh food `-`.

```fysh
><steven> ≈ [><({(°> - ><({(°>] ~
```

These fysh tanks can be traversed using a fysh.\
(Steven returns the element at index 1 (0-indexed))
```fysh
><steven>[><(({°>] ~
```

To define a function or SUBroutine, use a submarine `>(funcNameHere)` along with any
parameters `><param>`. By default, last expression in the subroutine acts as the
return value. To explicitly return a value, use a baby squid `<~` or `🦑`.

```fysh
>(submarine) ><param1> ><param2> ><param3>
><>
	<~ <fysh>< ~
<><
```

To call a subroutine, put the submarine in a fysh tank along with its arguments in any order. If two params are next to each other, seperate them with a fysh food `-`.:

```fysh
[><fysh1> >(submarine) ><fysh2> - ><fysh3>] ~
```

When we finally reach our destination, we anchor ourselves. Anchors are used to output the value of a fysh. They are represented by `(+o`.

```fysh
><//> prints 5
(+o ><{({°> ~
```

### Factorial Example

```fysh
><//> Comment

><number>    ≈ ><{({°> ~  ><//> b101 = 5
><factorial> ≈ ><(({°> ~  ><//> b001 = 1

><//> while number > 1
><(((@> [><number> o~ ><(({°>]
><>
	><//> factorial = factorial * number
	><factorial> ≈ ><factorial> ♡ ><number> ~

	><//> number -= 1
	<number><< ~
<><

(+o ><factorial> ~
```
