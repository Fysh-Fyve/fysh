# Functional and Performance Requirements

In the table below, the "CPU" refers to the Fysh-Fyve CPU, the FPGA-Based RISC-V
CPU compliant with a subset of the RV32I instruction set for the Zybo
development board. "Fysh" refers to the Fysh programming language, the
custom-made esoteric programming language for this project. "FyshSea" refers to
the Fysh Compyler, the compiler that targets RV32I with native support for the
custom RISC-V instruction.

<!-- Define any performance requirements and match to associated FRs, if
applicable. Keep below 20, but there can be more because there may be multiple
performance requirements for one FR -->
