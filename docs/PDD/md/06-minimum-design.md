# Minimum Design

In this section a minimum design, the "walking skeleton" is described. The
purpose is to define the functionality to be implemented in the first
development iteration. The outcome is reported to the client providing an
opportunity for early feedback.

## Fysh-Fyve (RISC-V Processor)

For the minimum design, our first iteration will focus on executing a single
instruction on the FPGA CPU. The purpose is to demonstrate that the processor
can be synthesized.

## Fysh (Esoteric Language Compiler)

As for the compiler, our first iteration would be to compile a single
instruction and upload it to the board. The purpose is to demonstrate that the
compiler can generate RISC-V assembly code and that the code can be executed on
the Fysh-Fyve processor.

## Stretch Project (Digital Aquarium)

As a stretch goal, we would want to implement a digital aquarium using RGB LED
matrix. This would showcase that the compiler can handle basic arithmetic, bit
manipulation, memory addressing and loops. For the hardware, it will showcase
Hardware RNG and GPIO.
