# Minimum Design

In this section a minimum design, the "walking skeleton" is described. The
purpose is to define the functionality to be implemented in the first
development iteration. The outcome is reported to the client providing an
opportunity for early feedback.


### Fysh-Fyve (RISC-V Processor)

Hardware RNG, UART, GPIO, and SPI. The purpose is to demonstrate that the processor can be synthesized and that the basic peripherals can be implemented and tested.

### Fysh (Esoteric Language Compiler)
A compiler that can handle basic arithmetic, bitwise operations, bit manipulation, memory addressing and loops. The purpose is to demonstrate that the compiler can generate RISC-V assembly code and that the code can be executed on the Fysh-Fyve processor.

<!-- Define the key features/functions to be implemented first and show how they
support an end-to-end functional system. The purpose is to implement the minimum
needed to prove that each major components works. 1 page max -->
