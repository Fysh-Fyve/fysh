# Final Presentation

## First minute

- Team intro & sponsors

$1: Hello everyone, we are Fysh-Fyve, although only consisting of three members.
I'm $1.

$2: I'm $2.

$3: I'm $3.

$1: Our project, titled "RISC-V FPGA-Based CPU and Programming Language",
started as a simple compiler project that has since evolved to become what one
would call a Full-stack Hyperpolyglot Gigachad Alpha Organism Free and Open
Source Software Capstone Project.

- What is the project? and how did it turn out

While this project is not a typical product, it serves as a amalgamation of
Computer Engineering concepts that we have learned throughout the program such
as computer architecture, compiler design, and development tooling. It also aims
to expand these concepts to use industry-standard frameworks such as the the
RISC-V instruction set architecture, the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and the
Language Server Protocol (LSP).

It can also serve as a reminder to future Computer Engineering students that
maybe there is such a thing as too much fun.

Before we start with the demonstration, we would like to thank our sponsor
Steven Knudsen, for even greenlighting this project, and for the myriad of Fysh
puns.

## Prototype Demonstration

### Start with Fysh

- Go over syntax
- Maybe have a diagram on how it's compiled
  - (fysh -> llvm bitcode -> riscv asm -> binary)

### Autocompletion??

- Hovering maybe??

### RISC-V CPU

- Architecture
- How the memory is laid out?
- Random Fysh

### Discussion

- what went right (of course)
- what went wrong
- where we went above and beyond (language server)
