# 🌊 Dive into Fysh: A Programming Language for the Sea 🐠

## Welcome to the Oceanic Future of Coding!

### 🐬 Meet Fysh: Not Just Another Drop in the Programming Sea 🌟

Fysh stands out from the school of programming languages as the first to bridge
the watery gap between human and marine intelligence. Picture a coding dialect
so intuitive, so adaptable, that it might just have dolphins fine-tuning your
functions and octopuses enhancing your algorithms. Fysh is more than mere
syntax; it's an underwater coding confluence!

### 🐟 A Revolutionary Ripple in the Digital Ocean

For too long, our finned friends beneath the waves have been unseen contributors
to technological discourse, their insights on digital complexities as hidden as
their opinions on theoretical physics. Enter Fysh: the long-awaited platform for
the aquatic inhabitants of our blue planet, heralding a new era of interspecies
synergy in tech innovation. Finally, a nod to the silent contributors of the
sea, a bridge across species, and admittedly, a slightly surreal dream come to
life for advocates of universal collaboration.

### 🌐 Fysh: Coding Without Borders

Why should humans monopolize the thrill of coding? With Fysh, we're scripting a
brighter, more inclusive tomorrow. Envision a world where salmon enhance your
interface designs, and jellyfish judiciously overhaul your systems. Together,
we're not just coding; we're creating a tidal wave of transformation, one
aquatic algorithm at a time.

### 🚫 **Discalmers:**

- **Aquatic Comprehension**: The ability of sea creatures to actually understand
  Fysh remains unconfirmed. Any effort to test this understanding might result
  in puzzled expressions from both marine and terrestrial observers.

- **Communication Limitations**: Given the current linguistic barrier with our
  underwater counterparts, Fysh temporarily excludes string variables. Our
  marine linguistics team is diving deep into oceanic communication and promises
  updates as new discoveries surface.

Dive into Fysh, and let's make waves in the world of programming, together!

# Fysh Language Syntax Guide

Introducing Fysh - the latest, greatest splash in the programming ocean! Fysh
isn't your garden-variety coding language; oh no, it's the world's most
_inclusive_ dialect, decipherable by brains both on land and under sea\*.
Imagine, if you will, a language so fluid, so versatile, that dolphins could
debug your code and octopuses could optimize your algorithms. It's not just a
programming language; it's an aquatic revolution!

For centuries, the fishy citizens of our planet's vast waters have been
overlooked, their contributions to the tech world as invisible as their thoughts
on quantum mechanics. But no longer! Fysh gives these silent swimmers the
platform they've always lacked but deeply deserved. At last, a beacon of hope, a
symbol of unity across species, a... well, let's be honest, a bit of a wet dream
for those who've always believed in inter-species collaboration.

Fysh: because why should humans have all the fun? Let's code a better tomorrow,
where salmon suggest improvements to your UI, and jellyfish judiciously refactor
your backend. Together, we can create a wave of change, one line of code at a
time.

**Discalmers:** \*Actual comprehension by aquatic lifeforms not yet proven. Any
attempts to verify such understanding may result in confused looks from both
fish and human onlookers alike.

\*\*Due to fysh not being able to speak, we have decided to not include any
strings in our language at this time. We are currently working on understanding
the language of the fysh and will update the language as we learn more.

# Dive into Fysh: The Programming Language Making Waves

**Welcome to the World of Fysh** - where programming meets the deep blue in a
splash of innovation! Unlike the land-locked languages that dominate the digital
realm, Fysh emerges as the globe's most _inclusive_ coding dialect, bridging the
gap between terrestrial and aquatic intellects*. Picture this: a programming
language so intuitive, so adaptable, that it invites dolphins to debug and
encourages octopuses to overhaul your algorithms. Fysh isn't just another entry
in the coder's toolkit; it's a maritime movement!

For too long, the aquatic denizens of our blue planet have been sidelined, their
potential contributions to the technological tapestry as unseen as their musings
on quantum theory. That era ends now! Fysh empowers these overlooked oceansiders
with the recognition they've silently sought and richly deserve. It stands as a
beacon of hope, a testament to cross-species collaboration, a... well, frankly,
a dream come true for anyone who's ever imagined a world where humans and fish
work fin to keyboard.

**Fysh: Coding for Every Creature** - Why let humans monopolize the fun of
coding? With Fysh, we envision a brighter future: a world where salmon fine-tune
your user interface, and jellyfish judiciously jazz up your backend. It's our
mission to stir a tidal wave of transformation, one innovative line of code at a
time.

**Fishy Footnotes:**

- _Disclaimer: The ability of actual sea creatures to comprehend Fysh remains
  unconfirmed. Efforts to demonstrate such understanding may lead to puzzled
  glances from both aquatic and human spectators._

- **A Note on Communication:** In light of Fysh's silent users, we've
  temporarily excluded strings from our language. Rest assured, we're diving
  deep into the linguistics of the sea, committed to enriching Fysh with every
  ripple of discovery. Stay tuned as we decode the dialogue of the deep!

Here is Steven. They are our icon. Our industry plant. Our fysh.

```
><steven>
```

Although Steven is a fysh, they are also a symbol. A symbol of hope. A symbol of
unity. A symbol of change. A symbol of the future. A symbol of the past. A
symbol of the present. A symbol of the ocean. A symbol of the land. A symbol of
the air. A symbol of the fire. A symbol of the water. A symbol of the earth. A
symbol of the heart. A symbol of the soul. A symbol of the mind. A symbol of the
body. A symbol of the spirit. A symbol of the human. A symbol of the animal. A
symbol of the plant. A symbol of the rock. A symbol of the star. A symbol of the
galaxy. A symbol of the universe. A symbol of fysh.

```

Although we love Steven, every fysh has to be terminated at some point. That's
why we end every line of fysh with `~`. (This is a tilde, not a dash. It's a
fysh thing.)

```
><steven> ~
```

Steven has binary scales. `}` represents 1 and `)` represents 0. Steven is
valued at `b101` (5 in decimal)

```fysh
><steven> = ><})}>
```

Steven can muliply with other fysh using the heart symbol `<3`. Steven is now
valued at b1010 (10 in decimal)

```fysh
><steven> = ><steven>  <3  ><)})>
```

Steven can also increment and decrement in value if they have 2 tails and swims
right or left respectively. Steven's value increases to `b1011` (11) then back
to b1010 (10).

```fysh
>><steven> 
<steven><<
```

Tadpoles also exist in the fysh language. Tadpoles swim towards bigger fysh
(they like the danger) and are represented by `o~ or ~o`. (`o~ = >` , `~o = <`).
Here we are checking if Steven is bigger than 6.

```fysh
><steven> o~ ><{{(>
```

In the whirlpool of fysh logic, the while loop, symbolized by `><(((@>`,
ensnares conditions within `[ ]` , with `><>` and `<><` encapsulating the
iterative heart.

```fysh
><(((@> [ ><steven> o~ ><))}> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><
```

Steven sometimes would like to comment on the state of the world.

```fysh
><//> Steven's thoughts on the state of the world
```

Factorial example:

```fysh
><number>    ≈ ><})}>   ><//> b101 = 5
><factorial> ≈ ><))}>   ><//> b001 = 1

><//> while number > 1
><(((@> [><number> o~ ><))}>]
><>
	><//> factorial = factorial * number
	><factorial> ≈ ><factorial> ♡ ><number> ~

	><//> number -= 1
	<number><< ~
<><
```

This example showcases the unique syntax and features of the Fysh language,
emphasizing its potential for creative and engaging programming.
