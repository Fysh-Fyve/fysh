# 🌊 Dive into Fysh: A Programming Language for the World to Sea 🐠

## Welcome to the Oceanic Future of Coding!

### 🐬 Meet Fysh: Not Just Another Drop in the Programming Waters 🌟

**Introducing Fysh** - the latest, greatest splash in the programming waters!
Fysh isn't your garden-variety coding language; oh no, it's the world's most
_inclusive_ dialect, decipherable by organisms on land and under sea\*. Imagine,
if you will, a language so fluid, so versatile, that dolphins could debug your
code and octopuses could optimize your algorithms. It's not just a programming
language; it's an aquatic revolution!

### 🐟 A Revolutionary Ripple in the Digital Ocean

For centuries, the fishy citizens of our planet's vast waters have been
overlooked, their contributions to the tech world as invisible as their thoughts
on quantum mechanics. But no longer! Fysh gives these silent swimmers the
platform they've always lacked but deeply deserved. At last, a beacon of hope, a
symbol of unity across species, a... well, let's be honest, a bit of a wet dream
for those who've always believed in inter-species collaboration.

### 🌐 Fysh: Coding Without Borders

Fysh – because why should humans have all the fun? With Fysh, we're scripting a
better, brighter, more inclusive tomorrow. Envision a world where salmon suggest
improvements to your UI, and jellyfish judiciously refactor your backend.
Together, we can create a wave of change, one line of code at a time.

### 🚫 **Discalmers:**

- **Aquatic Comprehension**\*: The ability of sea creatures to actually
  understand Fysh remains unconfirmed. Any effort to test this understanding
  might result in puzzled expressions from marine and terrestrial observers.

- **Communication Limitations**: Given the current linguistic barrier with our
  underwater counterparts, Fysh temporarily excludes string variables. Our
  marine linguistics team is diving deep into oceanic communication and promises
  updates as new discoveries surface.

Dive into Fysh, and let's make waves in the world of programming, together!

## 👩‍💻 How to compyle and run fysh:

TODO: Add instructions on how to compile and run fysh.

## 🐠 Fysh Syntax

This is Steven. They are our icon. Our industry plant. Our fysh.

```
><steven>
```

Although we love Steven, every fysh has to be terminated at some point. That's
why we end every line of fysh with `~` (flowing water)

```
><steven> ~
```

An autopsy of Steven's binary scales reveals the following pattern: `})}` where
`}` represents 1 and `)` represents 0. Steven's body is valued at `b101`. (5 in
decimal)

```fysh
><steven> = ><})}>
```

Steven doesn't give a flying fysh about their scale direction. ≈ for variable
assignment is cool with them too.

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><}({>
```

Steven is blind. You have the power to bless them with sight, but it's
completely optional.

```
><steven> ≈ ><{({°> ~
><steven> = ><{({o> ~
```

Steven can muliply with other fysh using the heart symbol `♡`. Steven is now
valued at b1010 (10 in decimal)

```fysh
><steven> = ><steven>  ♡  ><({(°>
```

Since fysh are lonely, they aren't too picky. They’ll make do with a lesser form
of love `<3`.

```
><steven> = ><steven> <3 ><({(°> ~
```

When there is a school of fysh, their collective value is equal to the sum of
each individual member. This gives Steven a value of `b101 = b100+ b001`.

```
><steven> ≈ ><{((°> ><(({°> ~
```

Sometimes fysh want to be different and swim the other direction. This takes
away from the school’s value. This gives Steven a value of.
`b101 = b111 - b010`.

```
><steven> ≈ ><{{{°> <°)})>< ~
```
