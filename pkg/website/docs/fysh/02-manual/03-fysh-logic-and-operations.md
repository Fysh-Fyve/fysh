# 🧠 Chapter 3: Fysh Logic and Operations

## 🤔 Logical Operations

- **`AND (&&)`, `OR (||)`, and `NOT (!!)`**: Steven is experiencing an
  existential crisis. They're questioning the very fabric of reality.
  - If steven is real `and` they found the truth, they're happy. (Steven &&
    theTruth)
  - Steven is happy if either they're real `or` found the truth. (Steven ||
    theTruth)
  - But then Steven thought about it and said "hey it would be kinda cool if I
    wasn't real" and is now only happy if they're `not` real. (!!Steven)

```fysh
><steven> && ><TheTruth> ~
><steven> || ><TheTruth> ~
!! ><steven> ~
```

## 🔧 Bitwise Operations

- Steven is bored and looking to have their bits rearranged. At Fysh, we're
  hereto help! We have provided Steven with a variety of tools and bitwise
  manipulations to satisfy their bit busting needs:
  - `AND (&)`
  - `OR (|)`
  - `XOR (^)`
  - `NOT (!)`

```fysh
><steven> & ><(({°> ~
><steven> | ><(({°> ~
><steven> ^ ><(({°> ~
! ><steven> ~
```

- **Logical shifts:** Steven can also use logical shifts! Steven shifts their
  bits to the left then right by 1.
  - **Left shift (`<<`):**
  - **Right shift (`>>`):**

```fysh
><steven> << ><(({°> ~
><steven> >> ><(({°> ~
```

## 🐸 Tadpoles

Tadpoles are Fysh too. They swim towards bigger Fysh (they like the danger) and
are represented by `~o` or `o~`. Here, we are checking if Steven is bigger than
5 and less than 7, respectively.

```fysh
><//> Greater/Less than
><steven> o~ ><{({°>
><steven> ~o ><{{{°>

><//> Greater/Less than or equal to (replace ~ with ≈ or =)
><steven> o= ><{({°>
><steven> ≈o ><{{{°>
```
