# 🐠 Chapter 1: Fysh Syntax

## 🐟 Variables

- Meet Steven, our fishy friend. In Fysh, variables like Steven are declared
  with `><name>`. Every line of fysh ends with a wave `~`.

```fysh
><steven> ~
```

- Steven has binary scales. In Fysh, `}` represents `1` and `)` represents `0`.
  Here, Steven is valued at `0b101`, which is `5` in decimal.

```fysh
><steven> = ><})}> ~
```

- Steven doesn’t give a flying fysh about scale direction. `≈` for variable
  assignment is cool with them too.

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><}({> ~
```

## 👁️ Optional Visuals

- Steven is blind. You have the power to bless them with sight, but it's
  completely optional! You can make them biblically accurate by giving them
  multiple eyes.

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{({°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{({o> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{({°°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{({o°> ~
><steven> = ><{({°o°> ~
```

## ➕ Arithmetic with Variables

- **Summing values:** A school of Fysh's value is the sum of each member. This
  gives Steven a value of `0b101 = 0b100 + 0b001 =` (5 = 4 + 1).

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{((°> ><(({°> ~
```

- **Subtracting values:** Sometimes fysh are negative and start to swim
  backwards. This takes away from the school's value. Steven's value is
  `0b101 = 0b111 - 0b010` (5 = 7 - 2).

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{{{°> <°)})>< ~  # 0b101 = 0b111 - 0b010
```

- **Multiplying values:** Fysh often get lonely. This loneliness causes fysh to
  meet new fysh and proliferate. This gives Steven a value of
  `0b101010 = 0b110 * 0b111`. (42 = 6 \* 7)

```fysh
><steven> = ><{{(°> <3 ><{{{°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{{(°> ♡ ><{{{°> ~
```

- **Dividing values:** Not every fysh story is a happy one. At times, separation
  is inevitable, and their division breaks their heart. This gives Steven a
  value of `0b101 = 0b11001 / 0b101`. (5 = 25 / 5)

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{{(({°> </3 ><{({°> ~
><steven> ≈ ><{{(({°> 💔 ><{({°> ~
```

- **Using parentheses for complex operations:** Fysh are often abducted and
  isolated into fyshbowls `( )` for terrestrials' amusment. This makes the fysh
  sad and gives Steven a value of `0b101 = 0b101 / (0b101 - 0b100)`. (5 = 5 /
  (5 - 4))

```fysh
><steven> ≈ ><{({°> 💔 ( ><{({°> <°}))>< ) ~
```

## 🔼🔽 Increment and Decrement

- **Increment:** As life goes on, we learn from our mistakes and improve.
  Steven’s self help journey allowed them to grow an extra tail, incrementing
  their value by 1.

```fysh
>><steven> ~
```

- **Decrement:** Sometimes we feel like a fyshup, a failure. And that's ok, it’s
  a part of being fysh. However for some fysh, this feeling is too much to
  handle and is internalized. They haven’t received the emotional support they
  need and have gone on a downward spiral, causing them to feel worthless. They
  begin to retreat and try to swim away in the opposite direction causing their
  value to decrement by 1.

```fysh
<steven><< ~
```

## 🍢 Random Number Generation

**Random Number:** This is a grilled fysh. It generates a random signed 32-bit
number that determines the doneness of the fysh.

```fysh
><###> ~
```
