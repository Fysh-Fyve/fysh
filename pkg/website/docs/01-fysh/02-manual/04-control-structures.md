## 🔁 While Loops

- In the whirlpool of Fysh logic, the while loop, represented by `@` or `🌀`,
  with the condition stored in either `[ ]` or `( )`. Small fysh define the
  iterative heart `><>` and `<><`.

Here we repeat the loop while Steve is greater than 5. Steven decrements by 1
each iteration.

```fysh
🌀 [><steven> o~ ><{((°>]
><>
    <steven><< ~
<><

@ (><steven> o~ ><{((°>)
><>
    <steven><< ~
<><
```

## ❓ Conditional Statements

Conditional statements run based on how each Fysh feels

- **`if` statement:** are happy since they're the condition you're looking for.
  They feel wanted and loved. They are represented by a happy Fysh

```fysh
><(((^> [><steven> o~ ><{((°>]
><>
    <steven><< ~
<><
```

- **`else` statement:** feel like they're the last resort, an afterthought. This
  makes them feel unimportant and sad. They are represented by a dead Fysh

```fysh
><(((*>
><>
    ><steven> ≈ ><(((°> ~
<><
```

- **`else if` statement:** are the middle child. They're not the first choice,
  but they're not the last either. They're represented by both a dead and happy
  Fysh

```fysh
><(((*> ><(((^> [><steven> ~o ><{((°>]
><>
    >><steven> ~
<><
```
