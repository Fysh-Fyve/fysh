# `fyshls`, the Fysh language server

`fyshls` (pronounce "Fysh shells") is the official Fysh
[language server](https://langserver.org/). Our main goal is to support syntax
highlighting and code completion.

## Features

This language server currently supports:

- Syntax highlighting (partial support for non-ASCII characters)
- Code completion for integers
