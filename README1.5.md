# Fysh Language Syntax Guide

Fysh is a fish-themed programming language that offers a unique approach to
coding through aquatic metaphors and binary scales. This guide provides an
overview of the syntax and features of Fysh.

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

This is Steven

```
><steven>
```

### Termination

Steven has to be terminated `~`

```
><steven> ~
```

### Literals

Steven has binary scales. `}` represents 1 and `)` represents 0. Steve is valued
at `b101` (5 in decimal)

```
><steven> = ><})}> ~
```

Steve doesnâ€™t give a flying fysh about their scale direction. â‰ˆ for variable
assignment is cool with them too

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><}({> ~
```

Steven is blind. You have the power to bless them with sight, but it's
completely optional

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{({Â°> ~
><steven> = ><{({o> ~
```

## Operators

### Addition

When there is a school of fysh, their collective value is equal to the sum of
each individual member. This gives steven a value of `b101 = b100 + b001`

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{((Â°> ><(({Â°> ~
```

### Subtraction

Sometimes fysh want to be different and swim the other direction. This takes
away from the schoolâ€™s value. This gives Steven a value of `b101 = b111 - b010`

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{{Â°> <Â°)})>< ~
```

### Multiplication

Fysh often get lonely. This loneliness causes fysh to meet new fysh and
proliferate. This gives Steven a value of `b101010 = b110 * b111`

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{(Â°> â™¡ ><{{{Â°> ~
```

Since the fysh are lonely, they aren't too picky. Theyâ€™ll make do with a lesser
form of love `<3`

```
><steven> = ><{{(o> <3 ><{{{o> ~
```

### Division

Not every fysh story is a happy one. At times, separation is unavoidable, and
their division is symbolized by a heartbreak

```
><steven> â‰ˆ ><{{(({Â°> ðŸ’” ><{({Â°> ~
><steven> = ><{{(({o> </3 ><{({o> ~
```

### Increment

As life goes on, we learn from our mistakes and improve. Stevenâ€™s self help
journey allowed them to grow an extra tail, incrementing their value by 1

```
>><steven> ~
```

### Decrement

Sometimes we feel like a fyshup, a failure. And that's ok, itâ€™s a part of being
fysh. However for some fysh, this feeling is too much to handle and is
internalized. They havenâ€™t received the emotional support they need and have
gone on a downward spiral, causing them to feel worthless. They begin to retreat
and try to swim away in the opposite direction causing their value to decrement
by 1.

```
<steven><< ~
```

### Error Handling

Sometimes Steven F\*shs up and throws an error. This can be done using two WTF
(What The Fysh) encompassing a string

```
><!@#$>
	What The Fysh?!
<!@#$><
```

### Equality

Not all fysh are created equal. But sometimes they are. We can check this using
`â‰ˆâ‰ˆ` or `==`

```
><steven> â‰ˆâ‰ˆ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> == ><theFysh> ~
```

### Inequality

But sometimes we want to ensure that two fysh are different. This can be done
using `~â‰ˆ` or `~=`

```
><steven> ~â‰ˆ ><theFysh> ~
><steven> ~= ><theFysh> ~
```

### Greater than

Tadpoles, curious by nature, gravitate towards larger fysh, perhaps seeking
guidance or a new destiny. This tadpole ponders if Steven has more than six
fins. (Steven > sixFins, Steven >= sixFins)

```
><steven> o~ ><sixFins> ~
><steven> o~â‰ˆ ><sixFins> ~
```

### Less than

Or, with a twist of fate, they explore if Steven is the lesser, a journey of
humility and discovery. (Steven < sixFins, Steven <= sixFins)

```
><steven> ~o ><sixFins> ~
><steven> ~oâ‰ˆ ><sixFins> ~
```

### Logical Operators

Steven is a curious fysh and often wonders if the world is as it seems. They
ponder the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. They seek the truth,
and if both steven and theTruth are true, they find it. (Steven && theTruth). Or
if steven or theTruth is true, they find it. (Steven || theTruth). or if steven
is not real and this is all a simulation, they find it. (!!Steven)

```
><steven> && ><theTruth> ~
><steven> || ><theTruth> ~
!! ><steven> ~
```

### Bitwise Operations

Steven is looking for a change and is interested in having their bits
rearranged. Given it's 2024, a time when open-mindedness prevails, Steven has a
variety of bitwise manipulation techniques at his disposal: `AND (&)`, `OR (|)`,
`XOR (^)`, `NOT (!)`. For those moments when he's feeling particularly
adventurous, he might even consider the `logical shift left (<<)` or
`logical shift right (>>)` operators.

```
><steven> &  ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> |  ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> ^  ><{((Â°> ~
! ><steven> ~
><steven> << ><{((Â°> ~
><steven> >> ><{((Â°> ~
```

## Control Structures

### While Loop

In the whirlpool of fysh logic, the while loop, symbolized by `><(((@>`,
ensnares conditions within `[ ]` , with `><>` and `<><` encapsulating the
iterative heart.

```
><(((@> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><
```

### If-Else Statements

Navigating through decision streams, if and else statements flow naturally.
`><(((^>` marks the if, >`<(((*> ><(((^>` for else if, and `><(((*>` for the
uncharted else.

```
><(((^> [ ><steven> o~ ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	<steven><< ~
<><

><(((*> ><(((^> [ ><steven> ~o ><{((Â°> ]
><>
	>><steven> ~
<><

><(((*>
><>
	><steven> â‰ˆ ><(((Â°> ~
<><
```

### Comments and Randomness

For those seeking the fortune of randomness, `><###>` unveils a 32-bit treasure,
while `><//>` whispers single-line comment and `></*>`, `<*\><` span multiline
scriptures.

```
><###> ~

><//> Comment

></*>
Comments
Comments 2
<*/><
```

### Arrays

A fysh tank `[ ]` is an array of fysh separated by fysh food `-`

```
><steven> â‰ˆ [><({(Â°> - ><({(Â°>] ~
```

These fysh tanks can be traversed using a fysh

```
><steven>[><(({Â°>] ~
```

### Factorial Example

```
><//> Comment

><number>    â‰ˆ ><{({Â°>   ><//> b101 = 5
><factorial> â‰ˆ ><(({Â°>   ><//> b001 = 1

><//> while number > 1
><(((@> [><number> o~ ><(({Â°>]
><>
	><//> factorial = factorial * number
	><factorial> â‰ˆ ><factorial> â™¡ ><number> ~

	><//> number -= 1
	<number><< ~
<><
```
